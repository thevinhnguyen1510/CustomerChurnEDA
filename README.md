# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data using the dataset from [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## 📁 Project Structure

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Dataset/` | Contains the original dataset downloaded from Kaggle |
| `CustomerChurn.ipynb` | Main notebook: preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling |
| `ChurnSQL.sql` | SQL queries for extracting and processing data |
| `Churn_Visualization.pbix` | Power BI dashboard with visual insights about churn |
| `README.md` | Documentation with project overview and instructions |

## 🧠 Objectives

- Explore factors influencing customer churn
- Analyze customer behavior based on services, contract type, payment method, etc.
- Visualize key metrics to support churn-related decisions
- (Optional) Build predictive models to estimate churn probability

## 🔍 Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing**: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: descriptive statistics, correlation analysis
- **Data Visualization**: using matplotlib, seaborn, and Power BI
- **SQL Analysis**: querying structured data
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Decision Trees.

## 📌 Dataset Information
